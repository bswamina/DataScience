### Motor Trend Cars Shiny App Documentation

#### Introduction

This __Shiny__ app allows the user to view the summary statistics of a subset of fields from the `mtcars` dataset. In addition, the user is able to visualize the relationships between `mpg` vs `cyl` as well as `mpg` vs `hp`. Finally, display a list of recommended cars based on the `mpg` selection.

#### Usage

Selecting _Automatic_ or _Maunual_ transmission displays the summary statistics based on the selection. If none is chosen, it defaults to both.

Selecting the number of cylinders updates the `mpg` vs `cyl` plot.

Selecting the horsepower updates the `mpg` vs `hp`` plot.

Selecting the mileage updates the recommended cars.
